# Thesis!


# Outline Draft

1. Introduction
    
    Ending in thesis statement or argument
    
2. Literature review
3. Data
4. Methodology (visualizations)
    1. Reasons and Logic
5. Body
    1. Funeral of a glacier and climate change
        
        *This is thought of as an entry point for the reader, and as a key narrative point.* 
        
    2. “The Economy”
    3. Actions to combat and recent developments
        
        *This is the bulk of the research and the thesis itself. Contains a lot of information and outlines the current state of things.* 
        
    4. ESG actions in numbers (comparisons )
        
        *A main argument chapter and connection finder.* 
        
6. Conclusion
    
    “Building a nature friendly economy”
    
    “Financing our survival”

I feel like I do not have enough experience with creative thesis writing to better define my outline. More research is needed

# Exercise2: FORM

The project will take a look at the funeral of a glacier in Iceland and look at it in a grander scheme of global warming, what business are doing to stop or halt it, and how businesses are ofter doing the opposite. For example, researchers Doug Koplow and Ronald Steenblik estimate that governments worldwide spend at least $1.8 trillion each year—equal to 2% of global GDP—on subsidies that are accelerating the destruction of our natural world. Why are we funding the destruction of nature with public money? And what can we do to stop it?

The goal is to impact the most amount of people, but the main focus will be on the 18-35 demographic who have a decent amount of financial literacy. Another aspect to think about is the fact people are often divided into two factions: Believers and non-believers. My project will require a fair amount of attention. The information is dense and covers a big area of research. The project also asks for limited input or interactivity. Main source of interactivity will be in the form of scrolling and interactive filters to demonstrate the “vastness” of the problem. The main audience takeaway is hopefully an eye-opening experience, a deeper knowledge about the problem all of us face.

## UI 
 * Use number to my advantage, the numbers in this project are very large and therefore hard to quantify easily, scale is then used to display the immense size of the problem.
 * Scroller changes state, show the disappearance of the glacier and changes of visualizations.
 * Easily acessible by most financially literate individuals
 * Interactive filters on later visualizations. Be able to change the year for example.
